<h3>Photo Gallery of the Tigger Team</h3>

<p>Just as much present to us during the making of this Documentary were the camera and sound teams – Sandi, Elizabeth, Rebecca, Mel and Helen. Sandi, Elizabeth and Rebecca had, in fact, stayed in our Enclosure before the filming started in order to get the feel of our life, and they immediately fitted in very well. While they were here they became known as the ‘Tiggers’, the diminutive form of the Company – Tiger Aspect Productions. We miss them and are always pleased to see them when they visit. Here are some pictures of them at work:</p>
