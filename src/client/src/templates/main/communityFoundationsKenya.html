<h3>Clare in Kenya<br />
Monastery of Our Lady of Light, Myanga</h3>

<h4>Beginnings</h4>

<p>On 3 June 1990 the Arundel community voted to make a foundation in Kenya. In October 1991 three sisters travelled to the Poor Clare community in Mbarara, Uganda to experience African Poor Clare life and in March 1992 they moved to Kenya and the diocese of Bungoma to which they had been invited by the then Bishop, Longinus Atundo.</p>

<p>They were offered land near the village of Myanga by a local family who wished to donate it in memory of their parents. The sisters returned to UK for more consultations with the Arundel community and in October 1992, after a Mass of Missioning, they left for Kenya.</p>

<p>The sisters settled in Myanga and supervised the building of the Monastery and the first Mass was celebrated on 1 December 1992. The building was done in several stages and culminated in the construction of the chapel which was consecrated on 19 July 2001</p>

<h4>Where We Live</h4>

<p>We are in contact with many young Kenyan women who are beginning the process of discerning whether they are called to Poor Clare life and we pray daily for more young women to join us. Over the years many sisters from our parent community in Arundel have visited us.</p>

<h4>Our daily life</h4>

<p>Our contemplative life of prayer and praise is centred around the celebration of Mass, the Divine Office and daily adoration of the Blessed Sacrament. We pray for the needs of the Church, our diocese and the many people who come to us for help. We also spend a good part of the day working at simple tasks. Cooking, cleaning and growing food. We make church vestments, candles and rosaries.</p>

<h4>Hospitality</h4>

<p>We have a small guesthouse and welcome people for a time of quiet, rest or for private retreats.</p>

<p>Please contact us if you would like us to pray for you. Also for booking a place in the guesthouse or if you would like more information about our community and way of life.</p>
