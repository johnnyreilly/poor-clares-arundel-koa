<h3>Our Work</h3>

<p>We not only work to earn our living, but still more we work as a way of sharing in God’s work of creation and in the work and struggles of the rest of humanity. Every sister contributes to the care of the house and garden according to her capacity. There is a rota for those who cook and another for answering the Front Door bell; parts of the house are shared out for the cleaning. Several others work in the garden. One or two are involved in the teaching and formation of new members. The Infirmarian and her helpers are closely involved with the care of the elderly and the sick. Each does what she can, just as each receives from the community what she needs, and this will be different for each person.</p>

<p>We have a small guest house where people can come to find rest and refreshment, sharing our prayer with us in our chapel and staying in simple, but attractive rooms. We try to share the gifts God has given us by enabling others to share our prayer in Chapel, and by praying constantly in response to people’s needs.</p>

<p>You can see round our guest house <a href="/static/tripAroundGuestHouse.pdf" target="_self">here</a>.</p>

<p>One of our Sisters paints icons, a slow and prayerful work.</p>

<p>There are numerous crafts practised in the community, the fruits of which are on sale in our small shop. One sister turns wood, several others make garments on knitting machines. Others make candles, encaustic wax cards, as well as cards created and printed on our computer.</p>
